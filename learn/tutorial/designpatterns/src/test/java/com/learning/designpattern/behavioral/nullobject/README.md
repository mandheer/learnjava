In **Null Object pattern**, a null object replaces check of NULL object instance. Instead of putting if check for a null value, Null Object reflects a do nothing relationship. Such Null object can also be used to provide default behaviour in case data is not available.

In Null Object pattern, we create an abstract class specifying various operations to be done, concrete classes extending this class and a null object class providing do nothing implemention of this class and will be used seemlessly where we need to check null value.

**Implementation**

We are going to create a AbstractCustomer abstract class defining opearations. Here the name of the customer and concrete classes extending the AbstractCustomer class. A factory class CustomerFactory is created to return either RealCustomer or NullCustomer objects based on the name of customer passed to it.

NullPatternDemo, our demo class, will use CustomerFactory to demonstrate the use of Null Object pattern.
