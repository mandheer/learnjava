####Problem

Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an **in-memory file system**. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.

####SOLUTION

Many candidates may see this problem and instantly panic. A file system seems so low level!

However, there's no need to panic. If we think through the components of a file system, we can tackle this problem just like any other object-oriented design question.

A file system, in its most simplistic version, consists of Files and Directories. Each Directory contains a set of Files and Directories. Since Files and Directories share so many characteristics, we've implemented them such that they inherit from the same class, Entry.
```java
 public abstract class Entry {
 protected Directory parent;
 protected long created;
 protected long lastUpdated;
 protected long lastAccessed;
 protected String name;

 public Entry(String n, Directory p) {
 name = n;
 parent = p;
 created = System.currentTimeMillis();
 lastUpdated = System.currentTimeMillis();
 lastAccessed = System.currentTimeMillis();
 }

 public boolean delete() {
 if (parent == null) return false;
 return parent.deleteEntry(this);
 }

 public abstract int size();

 public String getFullPath() {
 if (parent == null) return name;
 else return parent.getFullPath() + “/" + name;
 }

 /* Getters and setters. */
 public long getCreationTime() { return created; }
 public long getLastUpdatedTime() { return lastUpdated; }
 public long getLastAccessedTime() { return lastAccessed;
 public void changeName(String n) { name = n; }
 public String getName() { return name; }
 }

```
```java
 public class File extends Entry {
 private String content;
 private int size;

 public File(String n, Directory p, int sz) {
 super(n, p);
 size = sz;
 }

 public int size() {return size; }
 public String getContents() { return content; }
 public void setContents(String c) { content = c; }
 }

```
```java
 public class Directory extends Entry {
 protected ArrayList<Entry> contents;

 public Directory(String n, Directory p) {
 super(n, p);
 contents = new ArrayList<Entry>();
 }

 public int size() {
 int size = 0;
 for (Entry e : contents) {
 size += e.size();
 }
 return size;
 }

 public int numberOfFiles() {
 int count = 0;
 for (Entry e : contents) {
 if (e instanceof Directory) {
 count++; // Directory counts as a file
 Directory d = (Directory) e;
 count += d.numberOfFiles();
 } else if (e instanceof File) {
 count++;
 }
 }
 return count;
 }

 public boolean deleteEntry(Entry entry) {
 return contents.remove(entry);
 }

 public void addEntry(Entry entry) {
 contents.add(entry);
 }

 protected ArrayList<Entry> getContents() { return content; }
 }
```

Alternatively, we could have implemented Directory such that it contains separate lists for files and subdirectories. This makes the numberOfFiles() method a bit cleaner, since it doesn't need to use the instanceof operator, but it does prohibit us from cleanly sorting files and directories by dates or names.
