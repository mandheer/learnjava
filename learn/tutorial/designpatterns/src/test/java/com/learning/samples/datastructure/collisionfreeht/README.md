**Problem**

Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.

**SOLUTION**

Suppose we are implementing a hash table that looks like Hash<K, V>. That is, the hash table maps from objects of type K to objects of type V.

At we might think our data structure would look something like this:

```java
 public class Hash<K, V> {
 LinkedList<V>[ ] items;
 public void put(K key, V value) { ... }
 public V get(K key) { . . . }
 }
```

Note that items is an array of linked lists, where items [i] is a linked list of all objects with keys that map to index i (that is, all the objects that collided at i).

This would seem to work until we think more deeply about collisions.

Suppose we have a very simple hash function that uses the string length.

```java
 public int hashCodeOfKey(K key) {
 return key.toString() .length() % items.length;
 }
```

The keys jim and bob will map to the same index in the array, even though they are different keys. We need to search through the linked list to find the actual object that corresponds to these keys. But how would we do that? All we've stored in the linked list is the value, not the original key.

This is why we need to store both the value and the original key.

One way to do that is to create another object called Cell which pairs keys and values. With this implementation, our linked list is of type Cell.

The code below uses this implementation.
```java
 public class Hash<K, V> {
 private final int MAX_SIZE = 10;
 LinkedList<Cell<K, V>>[ ] items;

 public Hash() {
 items = (LinkedList<Cell<K, V>>[ ]) new LinkedList[MAX_SIZE];
 }

 /* Really, really stupid hash. */
 public int hashCodeOfKey(K key) {
 return key.toString().length() % items.length;
 }

 public void put(K key, V value) {
 int x = hashCodeOfKey(key);
 if (items[x] == null) {
 items[x] = new LinkedList<Cell<K, VÂ»();
 }

 LinkedList<Cell<K, V>> collided = items[x];

 /* Look for items with same key and replace if found */
 for (Cell<K, V> c : collided) {
 if (c.equivalent(key)) {
 collided.remove( c ) ;
 break;
 }
 }

 Cell<K, V> cell = new Cell<K, V>(key, value);
 collided.add(cell);
 }

 public V get(K key) {
 int x = hashCodedOfKey(key);
 if (items[x] == null) {
 return null;
 }
 LinkedList<Cell<K, V>> collided = items [x];
 for (Cell<K, V> c : collided) {
 if (c.equivalent(key)) {
 return c.getValue();
 }
 }

 return null;
 }
 }
```

The Cell class pairs the data value and its key. This will allow us to search through the linked list (created by "colliding," but different, keys) and find the object with the exact key value.
```java
 public class Cell<K, V> {
 private K key;
 private V value;
 public Cell(K k, V v) {
 key = k;
 value = v;
 }

 public boolean equivalent(Cell<K, V> c) {
 return equivalence.getKey());
 }

 public boolean equivalent(K k) {
 return key.equals(k);
 }

 public K getKey() { return key; }
 public V getValue() { return value; }
 }
```

Another common implementation for a hash table is to use a binary search tree as the underlying data structure. Retrieving an element will no longer be 0(1) (although, technically it's not 0(1) if there are many collisions), but it prevents us from creating an unnecessarily large array to hold items.
